        <h3>Research question:</h3>
        <h4>In modern times, which country is most happy in europe and is there a correlation to believing in god?</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/1.png"></img>
        <h4>Choose most recent wave to get most recent data.</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/2.png"></img>
        <h4>Choose european countries only by selecting them.</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/3.png"></img>
        <h4>Choose question feeling of happiness, it most resembles what I want to find out.</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/4.png"></img>
        <h4>Look at results, Sweden seems to be most happy in europe. </br>Now lets try and find a correlation with belief in god.</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/5.png"></img>
        <h4>Cross the question with belief in god</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/6.png"></img>
        <h4>For people believing in god, happiness seems to be the same as with only happiness</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/7.png"></img>
        <h4>Now change to people not believing in god.</br>
            The percentages go slightly up, meaning slightly more people</br> not believeing in god is happier than those who do.</br>
            This answers my research question: If you do not believe in god</br> you have a slighlty higher probability of being happier, but</br>
            note that the difference is only 2.5% higher for non believers</br> which is too low to draw any real correlation between the two.</br>
            Now is there a better view over europe?
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/8.png"></img>
        <h4>Choose map to more easily compare countries</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/9.png"></img>
        <h4>Choose europe only. It seems western europe is more happy than eastern europe. Interesting!
        </br>Sweden is still the most happy country, have it always been like that? Could it have changed over time?
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 10</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/10.png"></img>
        <h4>Choose Time series</h4>    
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 11</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/11.png"></img>
        <h4>Look at Sweden that was most happy, something happened between the 80s and 90s.
        </h4>    
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step 12</h3>
        <img src="discovery1/12.png"></img>
        <h4>Scroll through the page ans find that Netherlands indeed</br> was more happy than Sweden before.
            It was not until the </br>most recent wave that Netherlands dropped in happiness and Sweden became nr 1.
